//1 Declare a variable x and initialize it with an integer.

//2 How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer?
let x = math.round(7.25);


//3 Create a array called colors with the strings red, green and blue inside.
let color = ['green', 'red', 'blue'];



//4 How can you find the length of the string you just created?
let color = ['green', 'red', 'blue'];

//5 Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type. For example
let x = 5;
let y = 'Hello';

if (typeof x == typeof y) {
  console.log('SAME TYPE');
}
else{
    console.log(’NOT SAME TYPE');
}

//6 If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?
If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?

//7 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings?
let name=[‘Ayman’, 15, ‘HackYourFuture’, 200];

//8 Can you compare inifities?does 6/0 == 10/0? How can you test this?
let x = 6/0;
